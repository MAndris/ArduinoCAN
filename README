This is an Arduino sketch and circuit description that allows you to use an Arduino
as a generic USB/Serial to CAN converter.

There is a schemtic of the CAN Shield that can easily be built on a proto shield
as well as the Arduino sketch.  To install the Arduino sketch just copy the whole
'usbcan' directory into your Sketchbook directory.  Check the preferences of your
Arduino software to determine where that is.  A better way to install it would be
a symbolic link to this repository, that way any changes that you make will be
reflected in both places.

This device doesn't include all of the capabilities of CAN.  Since the primary
focus of this effort is to lower the cost of entry for somebody to start doing
CAN-FIX development we only included the features that were necessary for
that purpose.  Remote and Extended frames were deliberately left out since they
are not utilized in CAN-FIX at this point.

The software is licensed under the GPL so if you use it for what you like.

If you are curious what CAN-FIX is you can get all the details on the
